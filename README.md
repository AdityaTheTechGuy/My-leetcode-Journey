# My LeetCode Journey ðŸš€

Hey there, welcome to my digital workbench!

My name is Aditya, and I'm a second-year student figuring out this whole world of software engineering. This repository is my public notebook as I dive into Data Structures and Algorithms, one LeetCode problem at a time.

My real goal here is to get better, one day at a time. I'm focusing on truly understanding *how* things work, not just getting a green checkmark. This is the foundation for my long-term curiosity in AI/ML.

### What You'll Find Here

* Solutions to LeetCode problems (mostly in C++ for now!).
* My honest-to-goodness thought process, with notes and comments.
* A real record of my progressâ€”including the struggles and the "aha!" moments.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to learning and connecting with others on a similar path.
